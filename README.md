# README.md for qscript-framework

created: Lutz Prechelt, 2023-04-28

For several studies about different quality aspects of research articles,
we use scripts tailored to the particular study.

The present repo contains those parts of that scripting infrastructure that
is shared between multiple studies.
It is used as a submodule by the study repos.

The scripting infrastructure originated in the qabstracts study.
The framework was extracted when the second study was to be started: qconclusions.

The framework is small, the scripting infrastructure is simple.
There is no documentation beyond the comments in the code.
For information how the framework is used, see the study repos.
